<h3>Installation</h3>
Once you installed them all, you can proceed openning vscode from a terminal:<br>

```
code "target_container_directory"
```

Then, open your terminal on vscode with `CTRL + '` and execute the following command:

```
npm install discord.js ffmpeg fluent-ffmpeg @discordjs/opus ytdl-core --save
```
## clone from this repository

### setup

First, install git:

```
sudo apt install git
```

Check the git version that's installed:

```
git --version
```

Set your GitHub username and email:

```
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```
### how to clone

Generate your own key:

```
ssh-keygen
```

Type a name for your file:

```
Example output (in this case is public_github_key):

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): public_github_key
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in public_github_key
Your public key has been saved in public_github_key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256... user@hostname
The key's randomart image is...

```

Then output the file content in order to copy your ssh key:

```
cat "path_to_your_file".pub
cat ~/.ssh/public_github_key
```

```
Example output:

ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQCyPBe2gYuGQ9OfyrwMbedkpAwKG86NTibbIWdjB3zfMhdwtlM5ZkzHJPfeW+Xx6ykOBuRkacfWRPREeKAk/auiogJW3MtLq78 <br>/XsuCjjERFmy3OtCzLk4vfBRYSJw1lIXcgqLBus9cWv/bO8ISrDnh3EXU1/42sI6IIToGa0KsIaxP4W7tcgORl3Y36Qh<br>/JOdTigYekvVd/wPjjFveK9P2B4qU12ofrLVc+c1tyOszhMfZmUzLemDBnOX6JWPVTQINP/1VXTYwm5ZF5+/K4olgDZ<br>/JOreczcPoJJ0R1zrRrBBjM7GsRuIN2YdysXeQsjrcqpwjdlbU2LHmgNNghTe9l3syPfGWqOqz3zuijOf0UOEx2Arnf7MNBXYAodz0Ru5k6CA9WKDrb71q0PsVVBcbxRPgfkjsK48thX9+eNwDhf8bZo+xd9/OkO9lpiQDgieqvXdIApMT/fUt9sJNHDA1O1OfuWhwQBpmnDlNIvTBowmFTA5P7MG9tUtOBW7lE= user@hostname

## running factores

To run the bot on localhost, you first have to **create your own app**, in the [**Discord Dev. Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and
setup your bot there ([see how](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html))

### get token and config.json

In order to be able to run the bot, node needs a file called "config.json", create it from **vscode** terminal with:

```
sudo touch config.json
```

This file, **sould** look like this, replacing **"your-token"** with the token provided by Discord:

```
{

  "prefix": "!"
  "token": "your-token"

}
```
